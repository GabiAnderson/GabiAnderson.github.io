# Portfolio Website using Nextjs, Tailwind CSS and Framer-motion

I embarked on developing this portfolio website to explore new skills and further my coding journey. Utilizing a starter template from GitHub and following a comprehensive tutorial, I delved into Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Since then, I've continuously expanded and refined my portfolio. Currently, my focus is on optimizing the site for mobile devices, which involves reworking many reusable components. Below, you'll find the GitHub starter code, tutorial link, and more information.
