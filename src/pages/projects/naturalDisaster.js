                experiences. In the EAE capstone course, our challenge was to create a video game from the ground up. Following an industry model, we worked collaboratively 
                in smaller teams, with students taking on engineering, creative, and administrative roles.
                <br><br>
                This context required us to wear multiple hats due to smaller teams and shorter development timelines. Within the framework of <em>Natural Disaster</em>, I took on 
                various roles, including lead engineer, lighting engineer, UI/UX engineer, machinima producer, and more. This dynamic environment fostered adaptation and skill 
                enhancement.
                <br><br>
                Our games resembled those on platforms like Steam or Itch.io, offering an excellent addition to our portfolios. This challenge pushed us intellectually and 
                personally. By course end, we'd experienced the full game development process and thrived in an interdisciplinary setting, collaborating with peers, faculty, 
                and industry professionals.
