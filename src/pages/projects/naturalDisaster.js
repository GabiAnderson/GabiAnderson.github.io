                <em>Natural Disaster: A Butterflyâ€™s Guide to Mass Destruction</em>, a whimsical puzzle game now available on Steam.
                <br><br>
                This course brought together a team of 30 developers from various disciplines, 
                challenging us to collaborate and innovate while acting as a functioning video game studio.

              text={`The capstone course aimed to test and apply the skills acquired throughout our academic journey while providing guidance in abstracting our 
              experiences. In the EAE capstone course, our challenge was to create a video game from the ground up. Following an industry model, we worked collaboratively 
              in smaller teams, with students taking on engineering, creative, and administrative roles.
              <br><br>
              This context required us to wear multiple hats due to smaller teams and shorter development timelines. Within the framework of <em>Natural Disaster</em>, I took on 
              various roles, including lead engineer, lighting engineer, UI/UX engineer, machinima producer, and more. This dynamic environment fostered adaptation and skill 
              enhancement.
              <br><br>
              Our games resembled those on platforms like Steam or Itch.io, offering an excellent addition to our portfolios. This challenge pushed us intellectually and 
              personally. By course end, we'd experienced the full game development process and thrived in an interdisciplinary setting, collaborating with peers, faculty, 
              and industry professionals.
